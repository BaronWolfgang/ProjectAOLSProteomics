# Project AOLS Proteomics

This repository contains the code and data setup for Project AOLS Proteomics, focused on analyzing long-term performance proteomics data in Jurkat cells. Data was generated by Eckert et al., "Decrypting the molecular basis of cellular drug phenotypes by dose-resolved expression proteomics".
## What’s inside

- `AOLS_Project5.Rmd`: The main R Markdown file for analysis.
- `data/`: Large proteomics and metadata files (excluded from the repo, downloaded on demand).
- "AOLS_Presentation.pdf": pdf-slides used during the final presentation

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaronWolfgang/ProjectAOLSProteomics.git
cd ProjectAOLSProteomics
```

### 2. Open the R Markdown file
Open AOLS_Project5.Rmd in RStudio or your preferred R environment. Ensure that your working directory is the directory of the .Rmd file
